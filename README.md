# decr3pt
Decr3pt demonstrates how a basic XOR encoded payload can be executed in memory after decryption. I recommend hosting the encrypted shellcode on a secure server rather than locally.

How to use decr3pt:
1. Format the shellcode in "Format shellcode.py"
2. Encrypt the formatted shellcode using "Encrypt shellcode.py"
3. Insert the final payload in "Decr3pt.cpp" or cloud
